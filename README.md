Our paper performed a comprehensive data preprocessing and selected the most accurate prediction model based on the comparative analysis of the LSTM model. Under the prediction data, we found the best allocation weights for bitcoin and gold by the mean-variance model. Based on the best allocation weights, we used the mean-variance strategy to find the appropriate buying and selling points for the forecast day. Finally, we compared the transaction cost to decide whether to buy or not.
We selected the LSTM model with high accuracy and the comparison of the returns of two weight assignments Sharpe ratio and minimum variance by comparing the accuracy of two forecasting models, and the weight assignments with high returns for each forecast day could prove that the results deduced by our model are the best strategies. In addition, we computed some riskiness indicators. With our model, these riskiness metrics are met.
Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the model for transaction costs and concluded that the model had different sensitivities for gold and bitcoin. The model was more sensitive to bitcoin than to gold, and we analyzed that this was because the daily return on bitcoin was significantly more volatile than the daily return on gold.
